   <h3> Early Life  </h3>
   <p>  John Ronald Reul Tolkien was born in 1892 to Arthur and Mabel Tolkien in the Orange Free State, an independent Boer state which later became part of South Africa. At the age of 3, Tolkien's family traveled to England for a lengthy vacation--but after the tragic passing of his father,  his stay in England became permanent.  Moving to the English Countryside, Tolkien played and explored throughout the region, inspiring many of the locations in his later works.</p>
    <p>Homeschooled by his mother from a young age, Tolkien took an interest in botany, however reading soon became his favorite subject, learning to both read and write fluently at an early age.Language became another subject of interest to Tolkien--studying Latin lead him to grow interest in a written language made by his cousins, and later in life Tolkien invented his own written language.</p>
    <p> After losing his mother due to diabetes, Tolkien's guardianship was taken over by a close friend of his mother's, the catholic priest Father Francis. Continuing his education and moving between locations, Tolkien eventually met his future wife in a boarding house--Edith Mary Bratt. Due to religious differences, Father Francis forbade Tolkien from seeing her until his 21st birthday, which Tolkien waited for to resume his courtship, and on that very evening Tolkien wrote her a letter to propose, and after meeting with Tolkien again Mary accepted his offer.</p>
    <p>As World War 1 began, Tolkien was under heavy pressure to enlist--yet he opted to finish his education before enlisting. As the war still raged on after finishing his degree, Tolkien enlisted, training for nearly a year and commissioned as a second Lieutenant. Struggling through the many horrors of war, he eventually contracted Trench Fever, and was returned home to Britain. </p>
    <p>After the War, Tolkien began civilian work as a writer for the Oxford English Dictionary, before later moving onto tutoring undergraduates. Later, his career pivoted into becoming a researcher for the University of Leeds, and eventually becoming a professor. After returning to Oxford, he continued as a professor, and here is where he began working on his famous writings.</p>

<h3> The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings</h3>
<div class="Middle">


    <p>Throughout his career, Tolkien wrote several poems and short stories, publishing them in local magazines and publications. In 1930 while grading papers, Tolkien found a blank paper and began writing the story which would soon become <em>The Hobbit.</em> By 1932 he had completed the story, and had lent the manuscript out to several of his friends and students. After finding it's way to a publisher--and the book reviewed by the publisher's son--and by 1937 Tolkien's newly printed book had exploded in popularity.

    <p>After the major success of <em>The Hobbit,</em> Tolkien's publishers persuaded him to begin work on a sequel. After several attempts at a direct sequel, Tolkien eventually settled on his new story focusing on The One ring. Working his fulltime career, progress was slow on the story, and after restarting in 1944. After several more attempts and revisions, Tolkien's work was finally completed in 1949, and yet delays and disagreements with his publishers had <em>The Lord of the Rings</em> finally put to print in 1954.</p>

    <h3>Tolkien's Legacy</h3>
     <p>Following the release of<em>The Lord of The Rings</em>, Tolkien's work had an immediate effect on the fantasy genre, establishing lengthy, epi fantasy as a mainstay of the genre. Extensive world-building and the use of mythology and lore help to create a believable fantasy world, and the characters and archetypes created through them in the story continue to influence novels and stories today--as well as the lengthy, epic heroic quests taken by said characters. The use of a single, all powerful ultimate evil has been popularized by Tolkien as well, and all of these elements blend together and are used to this day by storytellers in many mediums--from books and novels to video games and movies.</p>
     
     
     <p>The massive reach and influence J.R.R. Tolkien has had is why I consider him one of the greatest authors to have existed.
